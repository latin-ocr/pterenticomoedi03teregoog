in mellus ‘nam si idem est, quomodo mellust’ This is
one 01 110 most glaring instanees where the acumen 01 110
great eritie has gene hopelessly astray. Terence does not
mean ‘you would have found the same 000 101101 one':
but ‘you would have found out the same thing in a iar
better manner than I’, 10. more easily or quiekly. 11

Terence had written irem, a subsequent melius would be
without sense. ,
