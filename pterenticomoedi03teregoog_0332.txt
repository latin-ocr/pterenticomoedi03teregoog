not see it, aud obstinately corrected a great number of
passages at variance with his preconceived theory of auni-

395 This passage is one of the most difficult in the
whole play. Itis commonly explained as follows: ‘for as
to a kind of hope yon might conceive, that Ι will easily

toa man of my dissolute life. Let me tell yon, that your
father would rather find for you a bride without any dowry
than thus let you go to perdition) But there are many
difficulties hnshed over in this explanation. First of all,
propulsare seems without any second example to support
the meaning ‘refute¹‚ which it must here here. Then it
would be quite uncertain whether leia mortem ought to
be taken as an abl. or dat: bnt see also Brix on Pl.
Trin. 769. mam (395) would, moreower, be without any
direct meaning. Fleckeisen seems therefore right in
assuming a gap after 395. The passage was already un·

important matters in arranging a marriage was the doe,

'wing his sister without dowry would be to gire her

emendicatam, not ia matrimonium. If, therefore,
Simo should prefer a daughter-in·law without any
dowry to Glycerium, it would show how strongly opposed
he must be to the idea of allowing his son to many the
‘swanger woman ’. corrumpi is frequently used of young
