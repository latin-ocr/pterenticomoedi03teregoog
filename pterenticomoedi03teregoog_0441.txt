422 PHORMIO.

the Bemb. 822 maror with an acc. stands on the
same footing with medicor c. aec. in Virgil Aen. v11 756.
There are many verbs which we find with the dative 111
classica] language, while the comio writers join them with
an accusative, eg. parco c. aco. Pl. Oura. 3813 ignosco
Amph. 2573 obrepo Trin. 61, 974; occurso Glor. 1047; and
indralpeo Eun. 222. 824 For evolvere conf. Eun. 723.
825 Nothing cau be more instructive thau the differenoe
here between oeietra and patefit: he is doubtful as to the
possibility of concealing the 111111, while he is almost cer·-
tain that it will become known. 828 The line is
altogether unmetrical, and looks very much like aglosi.
Bentley takes the trouble to arrange the words so as to
suit the metre; 111 his edition they run as follows, rogem
qood convectarat patriam tempas capere iubeat. Theline
is not explained by Donatus· 830 For poteretur see
note on v. 469. propria as his property, so as to romain
with him. 882 saraam ‘ take' ss holidays: cf. Ad.
287, where we have the original meaning ‘to spend' (comp.
sumptas) out of which grew the application in which we see
the word used here. , 834 absterrere is the reading of
the best msa, not aarum. 838 conficere ‘squander'‚
as dexrplained by Nonius p. 269, 17. 840 aba te: cf.
841 ‘Aliud Fortuna est, aliud Fors fortuna: nam Fors
sartura est cuius diem festum colunt qui sine arte eliqua
vivunt, huius sedes trans 'liberim est’ Don. Fortuna and
Fora sortaaa are deities entirely different: see Preller rom.
Myth. p. 553, and a note by Paley on Ov. 11111111 773.
842 Observa the play on the word oaero here and in the
next two lines. 844 On slaves hurrying through the
streete with their pallia (tarino) thrown across the shoulder‚
see Brix on Pl. (lapt. 775. 844 era tibi ‘there you are
again l' 848 The first words pergit bercto are an observa-
ticn addressed either to himself or to the spectatore, the fol·
lcwing words to the caller whom as yet Geta has not taken
the trouble tc look back st. 850 On capula Festus ob·
serves ‘tum dici solitum cum vellent minantibus signifi-
care se eos neglegere et non curare'. A passage very simi·
lar to this occurs in Pl. Asin. 4711. tua libero bomiri
Male servor loquere? LE. crapula. Mn. id tibi quidem
bercta fiet. 851 Ametive analogous to this is sup-
posed to influence Mr Stim in his intercourse with Raudal
in ‘My Novel' 1114, ‘This tone instantly inspired Mr Stim
with misgivings ι 11 was a tone so disrespeotful to him that
he was seized witli involuntary respect; who but a gentle-
man could speak so to Mr Stirn t’ familiarior ‘very inti-
mate’. amiram has here the sense it usually bears in the
mouth cf slaves, as is clearly shown by vapulare in the

· preceding line. 852 aad trae ert should be pro·⁴
