· (lomp. the following lines from Menander's Γεωργός (Μο10.
p. 36) ἐμβεβρόῖτησαι ’γελοῖον ὃς κόρης ἐλευθέρας Εἰς ἔρωθ’ ἥκων
tlte littus rtttttthht‘tt{telesti-‘tet
from this. 693 For dormienti 000 0. 00 Phorm. 1007.
697 ’100 Bemb. has nuuc ludis tu me and this is perhaps
the right reading. Diomedes quotes thelina without 0000.
698 qaia-tam micere=quo miserius. 699 00000000-
precare: before a marriage sacrifices were offered to Ζεὺς
τέλειος 00οἯρο τελεία. 760 Instead of eam the Bemb.
has in both places iarn. 702 perbenigne sc. facis ‘much
obliged to you': cf. Hor. Ep. 1 7, 16 iam satie ert. at trt
quantamvis tolle. berriyoe. 705 Fleckeisen writes quom
instead of qao which is, however, given by all mss. The
omission oi eo before magia may be defended: see Ruddim.
Inst. 11 p. 104 and 308. 707 quid 000 eat negoti ‘et
mirantis haec et laudantis oratio est’ Dea: herc of course
the latter. 700 ia sirau gestare is an expression denoting
wurmest attachment: cf. Cic. ad fam. xiv 4 iate bern eit
ia aiau semper et complexu meo. 711 ecieua=pru
dens, as is here shown by the antithesis of impruden in
the same sentence. Cf. Haut. 1050. 712 atem is
attested by Arusianus Messius p. 247 and should be retain-
ed3 Guyet writes aim ‘ex metri ratione ’‚ but this argument
is anything but cogent. ·
716 Here again Ι have adopted Klette’s emendation:
the mss. have illic fabrica alle. Fleckeisen omits ullo
altogether. 722 The old reading was ΜΙ. ecce autem!
DE. acco: but Fleck. is no doubt right in attributing the
end of the line entirely to Micio, comp. Eun. 297 cccc aaran
alteram. 727 Micio is interrupted by Demea who
000 hardly satisfy his eagemess to force all his news 00 his
brother. He was, perhaps, going to say ‘malim quidem
mutare si queam: nuno cum nequeam, sind, cf. 737.
734 0000070 with emphasis: cf 579. 769 Lipsius
(Ver. Lect. 1119) compares with this passage the following
lines of Alexis τοιοῦτο τὸ ζῆν ἐστιν ὥσπερ ol κύβοι. Oe·
ταῦτ’ ἀεὶ πίπτουσιν, odoi τῷ βίῳ Ταύτὸν διαμένει σχῆμα, μετα-
βολὰς δ’ ἔχει. Ηο adds‘ non affirmo Terentium haee habere
ab Alexide, Graecum tamen illum simile quiddam dixisse,
operae pretium putavi annotare'. See also 0000. bell. civ.
111 73 ai noa omnia cuderent secundo, fortunam esee iuduc-
tria sublevandam. 740 opus eat ‘what is preciselyuwanted
by us ’‚ i. 0. considered desirable. 742 corrector is very
ironical‚ as corrigar was just used by Micio: so Cic. Bulb.
8. Phil. 1117. 744 abicere ‘to throw away' by selling
under tho real velue: of. Phaedr. 1v 4, 42 agros obiciet
