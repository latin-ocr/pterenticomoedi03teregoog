01 Diphilus, viz. the rape oi the music-girl from Sannio’s
house: see note on prol. 6-11. The first-scene must
'likewise heve undergone considerable changes under Ts-
rence's hands, as Varro could not otherwise have tound
‚aucha difference between the first soenes in Menander and
Terence, as to justily him in his judgment preserved 1]
¹Suetonius in the Lite 01 Terence, ‘Adelphorum principium

Varro’s eruditior was never surpassed by any Roman, his
‘teste is-to sey the least 01 it-very questionable.

Lines from the Greek plays are occasionally quoted 1]
Donatus, 01 1] 01101 authors, and most 01 them may 10
traced in the Latin imitations: the most importent 01 these
will be found in our notes on the passages in' question.
From them it appears that Terence as a rule lollovvs the
Greek pretty closely, only ina remarkable instance, Ad. 866,
'we find that he substitutss trocheis tetrameters for the
iambic trimeters 01 his original. The same is the case ina
passage in Plautus’ 0111110110 written in trochaic metra

..while the corresponding Greek is again in iambica. Now, ⁴
trochaio mstre is very frequent in Letin oomedy, and it may
be admitted is eminently suited to the sonorous character
01 the Latin language. Hence it hes been 11101101, as it
seems, juatly that the Latin poete frequently changed the
metra of the Greek plays which they imitated.

We now come to another point which has recently
occupied the attention oi scholare to a great extent: via.
