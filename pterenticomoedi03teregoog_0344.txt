and thus ‘constant certain.' A similar sentence occurs in
the fragments of Euripides βέβαια δ’ οὐδεὶς θνητὸς εὐτυχεῖ
γεγώς, and another is ascribed to Diphilus βέβαιον οὐδέν’
ἐστιν ἐν θνητῷβίῳ. 718 Observa the climax from a mere
friend to the lover and husband. coactor has not neces-
sarily a bad sense, and the expression casta no stain upon
Glycerium's character. '720 laborem ‘trouble’ cf. 870.

Meineke reads it ἀπὸ Λοξία σὺ gaddiros τασδὶ λαβὼν ’Τπὸτεινε.
726 In Plautue’ Mercator 675 ss. the altar of Apoll0‚
