868 HAVTON TIMORVMENOS.

Puouocvs.

The commencement of this prologue will be found very
different in this edition from what it is in others. The nuru·

· bers of the lines alone (which I have left unchangedin

accordance with Fleckeisen's edition) indicate that 3 lines
have been omitted between v. c and 10. As to the
changes which it was found necessary to introduce into the
text, it will be best to translate here part of my article
‘Studien zu Terentius und Plautus’ in the jamdicto,
1865, p. 2821. ‘As we guther from the commencement

“ oi this prologue, it seems to have· been the custom with

prologues to be recited hythe younger members oi the
territabant}lttttttttttttttttlt?
self the behavicur oi a Roman audience during a perform-
ance, and there is no doubt that the noise used to be at its
height at the commencement and conclusion of a perform·
auce, i.e. during the recitation of the prologue and epi·
logue. Why, then, should an eminent actor waste his
lunge in reciting a prologue? It was but natural that
young end insignificant members of the company should
be employed for this purpose. Yet in one instance Terence
departed from this habit, Ambivius himself, the celebrated
octor, undertaking the inattractive pert of the prologue,
ney this was the case on two occasions, viz. on the first
exhibition oi the Hauton timorumenos and the third oi
the Hecyra. The whole question turns here on the third
line. Bentley’s explanation that Ambivius’ words deinde
quod vcaa' cloqaer shouldbe interpreted of theatrical acting,
ie. that after the conclusion of the prologue, he should at
once commence acting in the part oi Chremes without pre
viously leaving the stage, has been justly reiuted by
O. Dziatzko: Hec prol, 11 1 teaches us that the actor who
recited the prologue was dressed in a peculias eructuat
fact also confirmed by the evidence oi the prologue to the
Poenulus, where we read v. 126: valete, adesa: ibo, aliur
fieri nune volo, i. e. instead ofin the ornatus prologi you
will soon see me reappear as persona comica; but Daiatzko
iorgets to quote this passage. We are, therefore, obliged
to assume that v. 3 is intended to give us the logical dispc-
sition cf the prologue. In the first place, Ambivius intends
to state why on that occasion it should be himself and no
other who appears in the character of the prologue: aud
after this he is going to inform his audience what is to be
the subject of the prologue proper. But strangely enough,
all is arranged differently from what we are thus led to ex·
pect, and hence originated Guyet's and Paumier’s altera
tione, though it should be added that they were justly
reiected by Bentley's sound judgement. Agara, it seems
