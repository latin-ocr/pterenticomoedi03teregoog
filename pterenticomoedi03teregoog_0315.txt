—iikdfe1 under whom an exhibition 01 the play took placa
after t a poet's death. (Daiatzko rh. raus. xx165.) The
sequel of the didascalia in Donatus agrees well with this
supposition: egerant L. A ttilias latinus Praenestinus et h.
Ambivius Turpio. In the didascaliae we always find the
name of the manager whose troupe performed the play, and
L. Ambiviue Turpio is well known as the manager to whom
Terence entrusted his plays. He is mentioned as an excel·
lent actor by Cio. San. 14 and by Tacitus in the dialogus
de Or. 20. cgere fritillum means ‘to bringa play out', not
only ‘to perform it’; hence the manager is simply called
octor: cf. Haut. prol. 5. 051. 111011οἵ91. 33. Hec. 18. 291.
33. 47. Pl. Amph. prol. 88. L. Atilius 01 Praeneste is re·
peatedly mentioned in our didascaliae, but it is almost
certain that he belongs to a somewhat later period: see
especially the did. of the Hauton timorumenos.

The piece was set to music by Flaccus Claudi, ie.
servos (not libertus as is commonly assumed), of whom we
know nothing but that he wrote the music 101 all the playsol
Terence. According to our didascalia, the whole play was
set titiis 00111111,οη expression the exact meaning of which
is quite unknown: see Daiatzko rh. mas. xx 596.

0. Sulpicius Apollinaris is frequently mentioned in the

been his pupil at Rome, see xx 6: in another place, 1111111,
he calls him vir ia nostra 1111110110 praeter altos doctus:
x1xl3, we find him 111 company with Fronto and Postumius
Festus: for the other passages see Hertz's index: but what
hasbeen quoted is quite sufficient to show that Sulpicius
wasone of the learned pedants, though erhaps somewhat
better than his friends, who in the 1110111011 01 the second
century aiter Christ were endeavouring to 101110 Plautian
and Terentian language. It is just a man of this kind wa

play, which terminated with 11. sis-1003. In the oue

usually adopted no mention is made of Charinus' betrothal
aith Philumena.
