thenagainin Appuleius. 240 conentur is the only
reading which has good authority; we should supply the
infinitiver're‚ asin a similar passage Phorm. 52, and need
001 read cunctantur or still less carnanter.

261 erpellere is a word peculiar 10 001010 language and

266 fecimus is the reading 01 the Bemb. in accordance
with the invariable habit 01 Ρ100100 and Terence. Bentley
