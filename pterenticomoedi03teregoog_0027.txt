will now brietly describe the New 11110 comedy to which the
plays belong which were imitated by Terence end the other
0011100001001111011011010. 1110 generally known that
the extinction 01 the liberty 0111111010 wes 01 the 00110
time the 100111-1100110 the properly 000011οᾱ Old (tomedy‚
0 kind 01 Gemedy whose 3010101 character mey he defined
00 0011110111, und which wes therefore utterly inconceivuble
without the 11001011 010011110οΙ life end 01 unrestreined
liberty 01000001. We find thet the 00110 0001 whose
nemeis the glory 011110 11101011 Gomsdy, wue subse-¹
quently obliged in hie old ege to teme down his ehorp and
biting tongne,-only in the 10111 01 01 01103010 did he ven·
ture 10 ridicule the weeknesses 01 his citizens when he wrote
his Plutus. The Plutus is the sole specimen 01 the 00-
001101 Middle eomedy leit 10 us, end on the whole 031000
well with the description given by the 01010110 themselves

001 101 purely domestic, 10110 in its 0110111010 01 0011110111
allusione, neither tish nor flesh. Out 01 11 vus then deve-
100011 0 new kind 01 comedy, identioul with the one· still
