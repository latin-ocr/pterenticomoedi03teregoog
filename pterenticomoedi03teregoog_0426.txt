‚NOTES. ’ 407

see alsede fin. '111 4. A line of Menander runs τόλμῃ δικαίᾳ
καὶ θεὸς συλλαμβάνει, and one of Sophocles οὐ τοῖς α’θύμοιςή
τύχη συλλαμβάνει. 204 For the phrase apud se esse
see note on Andr. 408. 206 nou possum inmutarier
‘ostendit naturae suae timiditatem nullis adho1tationibus
eici posse’. Dou. 208 nil est ‘a matter of slight
difficulty’: see note on Andr. 449. 213 With saevi·
dicus Munrc on Lacr. 11180, compares spurcidicus Capt.
tc, and antidicus which occurs in the passage in Lucr.
protelare is explained by Festus tc be ‘longe propellere’‚
but his derivation from the Greek τ’λε is nonsensical.
Very likely, the word is connected wiih telum and 'thus
might mean originally ‘to drivc away by missiles ’τ whether
the word has anything tc dc with protelem (for which see
Munro on Lucr. 11531), Ι do not venture 70 decide. But
from Dbnatus' note it appears that the ancients themselves
knew nothing about the origin and first meaning of 7110
word. 216 As soon as Demipho himself is m sight,
Antipho's assumed courage suddenly evapcrstes.

218 Donatus drawa attention to the parallelism 'm rae
‘et peccatura meum and Phanium et 077011 aream: in the
second line uita and Phanium may be considered iden·
tical‚ as beloved girls ere frequently called ‘my liie' by
their adorers; 01 we may also explain the words ‘I recom-
mend tc your protectior Phanium, with whose saiety my
own life is closely connected: should I lose her, 1 should
make sn end of my own life’. And with this he hurries
away. 220 pennus ‘tiedtc the whippingpcst’.

223 aufer mi ‘don't mention the word, Ibeg’: for similar
passages see my note on Pl. sul. 630, and add iurgium binc
auferas Pl. Persa 797, pollicitationes anyer Ter. Phorm. 857,
auser friuolam insolentiam Phaedr.1116„8, assser ine uoltu
terrere, Hor. Sat. 117,42. 225 aonia ‘blame ’.

226 oirseibilis active: ‘apt to conquer'. (li. placabilius
Ad. 608. 229 in insidr's's is, as it seems, 7110 reading
,of the mss. and is also given by Nonius ll, 22, while
,Priscian 11 p. 415, 3, has the reading subsidiis which
Bentley prefers; 110 endeavours to prove that Donatus too
is in favour of it. Donatus observes ‘tota metaphora de re
militari est’ to which Bentley sagaciously adds ‘legebat
ergo subantis,- nam etiam extra rem militarem insidiae
sunt’; but here where insidiae are mentioned together ,
with odire (‘quasi ad proelium’ Dan.) and subcenturiatus,
Donatus’ remark is surely sufficiontly clear, and just.
Finally Bentley himself quotes Pl. Pseud. 959 ingredere
in uiam dolo: egomet bic in insidiis ero, which supporta
cnr reading cf the passage. subsidiis arose, no doubt, from
s confusion with the following subcenturiatus. 230 sub-
centuriati ‘dicuntur qui explendae centuriae gratia subiciunt
se ad supplementum ordinum’. Don.
