munouuoulou. 17

already given, aa it is of the most frequent ooo'urrenoe. See
Intrud. to the Aulularia p. xxxi.

It ia the same with the letter 1 which is dropt in nume·
rous instanoes : and here we have tho express testimony ol
Cicero Or. 48, 161 to the effeot that it was only during
hia own life-time this dropping of 1 final a fell into disuse1.
Thia is fully borne out by the evidence afforded by the
inscriptions of the Republican period, in which 1 final is
frequently omitted. (See also Schuchardt'a work 2, 46.)
Ι content myself here with repeating from my Introd. to
tlre Aulularia p. xxxii the following instances from the
Hecyra, which are all endings of iambie lines: 11104111 114
334. defessus sum 443. 1110014111 sum 450. expet-tin sum
409. nullia sum 653. 111111 114878. 14 will also appear from
these instantes thatin tho case ol the letter 1 the prosody
ol the comio writers went beyond tho limita explained in
ἐξ 1 and 11. The same licence extende to m final, but with
regard to other final consonante we meet with no deviation
from 4111 rule. ’

r is dropt² in moro than one instance:

soror dictast Eun. 157.

color 1011111111. 310.

amor misericordia Andr. 261.
pater venit Phorm. 601.
mfser quod habui Eun. 237.

In the same way we 1111140 explain the instancea in
which a final t 01 d is dropt. Thus opud should fre-
quentlybe pronounced apa or apator the latter form occure
in an ancient glosaary ‘ape napt’ (Bitschl, rh. mus. x1v
400: see also Schuchardt 1, 123). With regard 40 verbs we
quote the following instuncos from Terence:

amet: dabitur 4 me Ad. 110.
dabit nemo Andr. 396.

mihi dedit consilium Eun. 1045.
dolet dfctum Eun. 430.

erat quidam Eun. 509.

erat mfsea Ad. 018.

¹ Marius Victorinus 1p. 14721. likewise testifica to the frequent

droppiug of the flnal a in Lucilius, and adds in general ‘hae syllabae
(final a with a following consonant) pro brevibus apud veteres, pro
longis vero apud omnes ponuntur:
