454 ADELPHOE.

hilaris, hilare autem ab hilarus, ut Helonius Aaron in
Terenti Adelphis, ubi Terentius hilarem bane aamamae in·
quit diem ’1 so that either Bentley is right in assuming the

mss. of Charisius to be wrong, or Charisius himseli found in ’

the mss. oi Terence accessible to him the reading hilarem,
though he knows that-Helonius Acron was in favour oi
hilare. But however this may be, there is no doubt as to
what is the genuine reading oi the passage as Terence
nowhere uses hilaris, but always bilamra. Plautus has
hilari 'iaaeaia Most. 318: and in a passage resembling the
present in the Ad.,1>oen.v 6, 29 f. baac festam diem Ha·
beamus hilarem.

289 modo oi present time is rare: see, however, Munro
on Luor.111135. amo ta ‘my dear’: without ta Pl. Most.
346, Ρο10. 764, Cist. 1 1, 61. recte apem: cf. Haut. 159.
priiaalam occurs also Pl. Men. 917 occeptat iasaaire primu·
lam. 292 Both relative sentences belong to nemimem
laceo. 294 semperis pleonastic in the dependent
clause, though it imparis greater emphasis to the assertion.
295 eae mata ‘as things are’. 297 aeaeae is the
ms. reading, ior which Bentley was the first to write ia-
pemio, as it seems hardly possible that Terence should use
v tali gemere and matam ca taata familia in such close vieinity.

299 qaam is Guyet's emendation oi the ms. read.
qaod, supported by such passages as Pl. Capt. 513 acac
illud eat quom mc scisse qaam eoae mimia mavelim, and Rud.
664 amoc id est qaam—viduitas aaa temet. On the cor·
responding phrase in Greek νῦν ὅτε 000 Hermann’s note on
Soph. Ai. 789. amma amaia is the order in the mss.; I
prefer Bentley’s transposition amaia amaea on account 01
the parallel passage v. 978, and because it is still an open
question whether a dactylis word can repluoe a trocheo in
Terence and Plautus. 302 Tvvo different metaphora
aro here mixed. On emerat Donatus observes ‘emergi nove;
nam emerge dicitur, non ememor: sed ideo est usus quia extra
compositionem et merae et aseraoaiaeit'. Β11101.Α11(11.562.
303 According to Poliziano, the Bemb. has solicitudo in-
stead oi solitudo: but I have not ventnred to introduce this
into my text. 393 illamispleonustic: similuraon-
structione are found in Greek 307 iactabat sc. ei
which is almost necessary ior quoi inthe next line. .
311 For dart see Introd p. 15. 313 satia mibi habeam
supplici ‘I shall think it sufficient punishment ior them':
ci Pl. Most. 1165, where the same expression occurs. As
it is impossible to admit the hiatus dam-illos, we are obliged
to assume that a word is lost; Fleckeisen gives areo modo,
