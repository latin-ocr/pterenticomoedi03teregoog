INTBODUCTION. 21

Other examples of synizesis will be pointed out in our
notes on the passages where they occur.

Finally it should be observed that compounds in which
two vowels come together, are in the eomie writers always
pronouneed with synizesis.

VH. Hmrus was formerly assumed in many passages ol
the comio poete where either the common reading was wrong
or the line admits 61 a different scanning. In general it
may be said that hiatus is justified only (1) where the line
is divided among two or more speakers, or (2) in the legiti-
mate caesurae of all matres. Hiatus is of very rare occur·
rence in Terence. ⁵

Quite different from this are those instan'ces in which
monosyllables terminating in along vowel or m do not
coalesco with a following short vowel, eg.

ride quarn iniquos 616 prae studio: ddm id efficias

qu6d cupis Andr. 825.
ego cum fflo, quocum tum imo rem habebam htspite
nostin hano quem amat frater Eun. 563. Eun· 119.
dice noctisque me ames, me desideres Ε1111.193,

Other metenses occur Andr. 191. Hec. 343. 1116111127.
Eun. 1080 etc. similar cases are not wanting in later
poete, eg. Virg. eol. v111 108 6111 qut omont: see also

Munro's note on Lucr. 11 404.
As concerne the metros 61 Terence, the student is here

advised to consult the table of metres appended to each play.
It hes been observed before (11.3) that Terence was

“ amply rewarded by the praise and admiration of posterity

1611116 coldness he met with from his contemporaries. His
comedies were frequently performed after his death end
were much read both in the schools and in the oloset.
Cicero quotes Terence in many passages and always ex-
presses high admiration 161 him: end Horace who alludes
to passages in Terence's comedies never presumes to epeak
. as slightingly 61 him as he does of Plautus. In the times 61
imperial Rome grammarians wrote notes on Terence's plays
with a view to the explanation both of style and dramatic
art, ol them we name Asper and Probus who are also
known as commentatore⁴ of Virgil. In the fourth century
the playa were commented on by Aelius Donatus, Relenius
