by latonae, buttlrere can be no doubt that he found it in
his Greek original, and that the whole notion ol his having

- Aa regards the Haaton timommerwe, we hare Terenoe’s
own asmance that it was solely based upon a play of
Menander which bore the same title.

· The Phemio was taken from the Ἐπιδικοζόμεοοο of

In the case ot the Hecyra it is not easy to settle the
anthorship of the original, as Donatus in his additamentum
