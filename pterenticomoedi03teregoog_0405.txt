cute the knot instead of solving it she pronounees the line
to be spurious) can hardly meet with anybody’s approval:
Boeclerus had proposed baie instead of tibi, but how could
the latter have been substituted for the former? It would
indeed be difficult to account for a change of this kind

511 Faernus had, though doubtfully, assumed a form
coagmen ‘ut quod forte sit secundae declinationis’; but
Bentley adds ‘apage illud coapoueo’: yet what he gives
himself consentire instead of congessere is hardly better as
this is a word much later than Terence, and is scarcely
found in any writer before Cicero. (las. prol. 59 propterea
eo ano commta crem silio is not written by Plautus, as the
whole prologus to the Casina was eomposed for a perform·
ance which took place after Terenoe's death. And even
there consentit is perhaps no genuine reading, and we
should conjecture contendit. Fleckeisen adopts the reading
given by Bentley’s ‘Vir doetus', i.e. F. Here, ne nosmet
inter ads congruere sentiant: but this is only a very cheap
way of getting over the difficulty. If congruam be utterly
inadmissible‚ I should even then prefer are acie rsrr inter

before rurae-but there is another consideration against
this conjecture: viz. the words tetanos must be pronounced
so as ιο let noe appear as an enclitic: internos, whence it
follows that either we must revert to coagmen, as recently

513 Syrus addresses the money which has not come to
him yet: circumcirca ‘run about', as if he were pursuing
the money which was trying to escape him. Bentley, who
was the first to give this explanation, justly compares
v. 678. 518 recte ‘ioco rult Syrus deflectere oratio
nem in aliud st subterfugere eri reprehensionem’. Golpb.

524 An excellent observation by Bentley ‘palpatur seni,
temporis acti laudatori, quasi illo iuvene formosiores essent
