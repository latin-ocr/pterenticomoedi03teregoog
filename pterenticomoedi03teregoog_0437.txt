111372. Yet thefact had already been partly anticipated by
Mericus Casaubonus. 699 utibilis occurs only hersin
Terence, who has utilia in all other places. coimus is here
the reading 01 the Bemb. ms. (see Umpienbach, Hermes 2,
p. 382), while all other mss. and Donatus read ulcus, and
indeed ulcus ccupare occurs in an analogous passage in Cic.
N.D. 1 37 borum quidquid attigeris, uicus est, where
ulcus means the weak side of an argument, and Donatus
even tells ns that the phrase was used as a proverb. But
on the other hand there is uo reason for rejecting colum
which is tha reading ol the best mss: and Torcellini
quotes a sufficient number of passages in which the word
means ‘calamitas casus adversus, pernicies, damnnm’.
Itis olcourse easy enough to say that veluus is merelya
gloss 01 ulcus, bnt I conceive it is very difficult -to prove
that it must be so necessarily, while if uicus were found in
the Bemb. and uoluae in later mss, the ease would be clear
at once. 693 uxor ducendast domum depende onai
