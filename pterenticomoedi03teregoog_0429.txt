410 PHORMIO.

368 The 110111 videas te atque illum 11 nanae have been
a stumbling-bloclr 10 the commentatore ever since Dona-
tus who gives no less than 10111 explanatione 01 the pase-
· age: but in his long note 111111 only one remark which
really bears upon these words, viz. ‘allusit ad illud quod
,111 quem ego viderim 111 cita 0111111111ηᾶ Υ11 I do notthink
that the passage 11 in reality very difficult‚ 11 111 translate
‘compare yourseli and him, according to your description’,
i.e. according to your tale he was such an excellent 1111111-
101; well and what are you? you epeak in such ahigh morel
strain, and yet we all know who and what you are: hence
111 may well doubt whether your account 01 Stilpp’s charae·
ter be correct. This long periphrasis comes 10 the same ee
Donatus' first explanation ‘parem 11 illi existimo atque
illum tibi’. 370 lianc is here shortened and the

tandem has been noticed on Andr. 875. Bentley says
*1111111111 versui officit et sententiae’‚ 111101111111111 cor·
rarissimarum, acorrection Ι arn surprised to 111 adopted
in Fleckeisen’s text. Aspondee in the fourth 1001 isbyno
means rare, nor is it in any way objectionable that this
1001 should be filled up by a single 11011. As 1011111 sense,
tandem is simply ironical as in many other passages,
