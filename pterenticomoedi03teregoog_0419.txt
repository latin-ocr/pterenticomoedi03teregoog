scripsit 11 the reading of the mss, but as Donatus says,
‘legitur et fecit', Bentley adopts 11111 11 once, quite forget·
ting that this reading can only be due to 1 scribe who put
fecit here in imitation of 1. 4. Bentley says, moreover,
‘faciendi verbum poetae proprium’, as 11 scrihere did not
occur in the same way, while we have accipteroof poetical
style only one line before. 7 8 We donot know what
was the precise nature 111111 11111 in 11111 Lavinlue'

Menaechmus simulatas medness (cf. 11111111 eduleecea·

11111111 soenes in tragic poete where Agave mistakes her

then indeed Terence's criticiem would be very unjust. t
might ecem that 1 supposition 11 this kind would not be
111 from the 111111, 11 Donatus says ‘hacc omnis περίστα-
σις tragica, 11 ideo in comoedia vitiose inducitur’. 9
For stetit see Introd. p. 14. stetit means that Lavinius'
play was received favourably, 1111 when 11111 exhibitcd.
