NOTES. 467

Dinners were generally late in the evening (Haut. 248), and
to have an elaborate dinner (et. here adparere) in the mid-
dle of the day was considered very extmvegant. 979
neor is here the nobler word instead of contubernalis, the
proper neme for the wife of a slave. 980 prae manu
dore ‘edvanee in ready money': see Pl. Beoeh. 622 petri
reddidi quod fuit prae amau. 981 istoc vilius ‘quasi
nihil minoe: negatio enimi est flooenm ostendentis aut quid
tale, eum ἐλλείψει quia subauditur quicquam et non dabo.
hoe egit Ter. nt conversis offioiis usqne adeo prodigum
laceret Demeam, donee pereum redderet Micionem’. Dora
985 We have here an allusion to a line in Oeeeilius 93 n:
qood prolubium, qoae‘ voluptas, quae te laetat ldryitae?
Donatus explains ‘prolubium quod Graeci rpoream, from
lubet. 986 ostenderem is dependent on mutavit 984.

987 For vera vito eomp. vere vivitur Haut. 154. vita
means here ‘the way ot living’. 990 tusto iniusta καὶ
δίκαια rddere: ef. Andr. 214 and Haut. 839 with note.

996 The play ends with this result: both brothers see
that they have carried their theories too ton Micio has in-
dulged his son so that he loses all authority over him,
whilst Demea so lar relaxes his severity as to permit Ctesi·
pho to retain his beloved psaltria. Yet, though so mueh

⁴ has boen written in justification ol the fifth eet ol this

oomedy, it eannot be denied that in it great injustiee ie
done to Mioio es well as to Aeschinus who maintain too
high a ehareeter in the first four eote than to narrant their
sudden ohange in the fifth, ae it seems hardly consistent
that Aeeohinus should lend himself to the jokes Demea
plays upon hie brother, or Micio should oppose so tame and
spiritleee a resistanee.
