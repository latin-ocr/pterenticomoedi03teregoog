him on ins different psth. Plautus is more amusing,
Terence certainly more plessing. The very charged dul-
ness ond went of variety in his plsys brought forvsrd
egsinst Terence by his adversaries goes fer to prove the
correctness of our views on this subject. Lst us edd thst

· And efter oll, there is one point in which Terence took
grest liberties with his Greek originels, end where he hed
ample opportunity of showing thet he wss really endowed
’ with some of the qualities oi s crestive mind. As in the
Greek comedies s very prominent port wss allotted to
dislogue, while Romen teste required more variety end
s quicker succession of oetion, it hed becomes frequent
practice with the Romen poete before Terence, not to con-
fine themselves to merely trnnslsting one Greek pisy, but
to teke two or perhaps even three pleys whose plote were
somewhot slike sud to fuse them into one. By this means
they contrived thst the interest of the audience should
not be sbsorbed entirely in one plot, but thst besides
the principnl plot there wss also en under-plot which of

course grestly added to the veriety end interest of the ”

plsy1. We mey es well edd that we observe the seme
practice in Shehespesre snd in other experienced drnmstic
writers, end it would thus sppeer thet the Romen poets
were not unwise in edopting the above-mentioned practice.
Itis generally designsted by the neme oi contaminere,
which word seems to hsve been used ior it originally by the
malevolent adversariesof Terence: seenoteon Andr. prol.

originally different pisces were united by the hand oi the
poet. tht oon be asserted with s tolerabis degree of
certainty sbout the compositiones the single comedies of

tium pavoribus, gaudiisque componitur, cum fers solem Hecyram
Terentius ex unius comoedia adulescentis effecerit? And itis ohs-
mter-letio thot it wss precisely the Hecym which the Romen public
⁴disliksd most of sll Terence’s semodios-tho ughtbis wss not solely
ducto the simplicity of the plot (seen. t).
