In the didascalica or titali prefixed to each play, ve pos-
sess the results of the critical labours of Roman gramma-
rians in the vth century nc. concaming the chronology of
Terence’s comedies. The principal source of the notices con-
tained in these didascalice is probably to be found in notes
entered into copies of the plays originally used by and
belonging to stage-managers; attha sometime, these gram·
marians doubtless availed themselves of the so-called com·
mauturii magistratuum, in which an accurate account was
kept of all exhibitione made by the magistrates on, the
meat annual festivals. On the investigatione of the older ·
grammaticus vas based Varro's work de actionibus scac-
ae'cia and to this our didascalice in their present form may
be traced as their real source. (See my remarks, jahrb.
1865 p. 293, and 0. Daiatzko ula maa. m etl-92.)

In Donatus' preface we have the corrupt words, M. Palaia
aedilibus et Μ ’ Glabrione Q. Minucia Valerio curulibus. In
the year 588, when the Andria vas first brought out,
M. Fulvius and M’ Acilius Glabrio vvere aediles curules
(on this dignity consult the Dictionary ol Antiquities). The
other two names, Q. Minucius and (L 1) Valerius (Flaccus l)
very probably belong to two aediles oi a later period (a. 611
