veliem Menedemum invitatum would be against the truth.

de re metr. p. 386 writes etque citium uunce tempus eat, but
a form uriuce is not attested in other passages and cannot
beassumcd for this alone. 188 etium ‘ as yet '.

189 In omniu notice the original quantity of the neutra]

this preposition differently: pariter te ease erpa iilum uideo,
ut iilum ted erpa acio. 190 misereemet‘loves her

In former editions we read eredere est with the explanation
ἔστι νομίζειν anda reference to 11111128 scire eat. But
Lachmann on Lucr. v 533 shows that constructione like
these have nc good authority in early authors and that we
must read crederes here and scires in the Adelphoe. 195

For -mus qui ea· see Intrcd. p. 21. 19? In reuda the
final n was very probably sounded like a: see Introd. p. 18.

called him aenea importuurcav.197. Β111 if Chremes in- ·

tendedto include his son, he ought 10 have said insimulatis,
ior obvious reasons. Yet after all, the reading of the
Bemb. may be the true one, aa we may understand iam
simulent ‘pecple accuse him ol being hard', thus supposing
that Chremes would give his son the impression thathe had
heard others talk of Menedemus* behavicur towards Clinia.
