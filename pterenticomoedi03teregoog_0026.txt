Suetonius, to whom we owe our information‚ adds that
Terence was oi middle stature, slender figure and dark
complexion. Though he died so young¹‚ he must have
been married, as we are told thatadaughter oi his married

. aRoman knight. Suetonius quotes, memoror, some lines

which would seem to prove that Terence died in extreme
poverty, the writer saying among other things ‘ae mum
quidem babuit conductiones, Saltem ut esset qao referret obi·
tam dorstat semota! On the other hand we leam that he
was possessed of a gardan near the Via Appia, and accord-
ing to a very probable conjecture, there may have beena
villain that gardan. How, then, are we to reconcile these
two relations? It hae been shown already that scandal-
mongers have had not a little to do with the storias circu-
lated about Terence’s life, and the writer oi the lines in
question was no doubt hostile to the Scipios and the other
aristomatic friends oi our poet, who (as he says) first used
or rather misused him and then let him die in want and
misery. But it should also be mentioned that it hasbeen
pointed out that demea conducticia would naturally mean a
town house, and this might easily be above the means oi
the humble poet, though possessing a moderate country·
house. But whether this nice distinction was exaetly in
the intention oi the satirist who leit us those lines, is
matter oi great doubt. ⁴

We have already attempted to give a general idea of the
peculiar character oi Terence’s eomedies and oi their differ-
ence irom the works oi the other comio writers oi the

Romans. It was observed that Terence kept as close as
possible to the Greek character oi his originals²‚ and we

commonly assumed that the post had reached the age of ³53 but the
best authorities are there in favour of the reading condam quintam
