praeced, as lnthe first clause Clinia is the subject, and
Menedemus in the second, although it requires a moment’s
reflection to find this out. Bentley writes, therefore, cbiyct
‘until he (Menedemus) driwes him (the son) away again’,
thus getting the same subject in both clauses. But I think
that my reading is 111 sasier: bic naturally denotas Mene· ’
demus (11.1. 5491111111 etur is the son. 545 cd
‘towards’. The sallario (513) 11 considered as a machine
which is to be used against the old man. 540 tacto

557 It is not without irony that the slave repeats the
expression used by Chremes himself, 1. 553. 559

adopts male jacere, an emendation of Muretus, without
any particular advantage3 ior the construction 111111 male
jacerem is perfectly good Latin'. There is little doubt that
Bentley knew Latin as well as Parry; but he very likely
thought that any attentive reader would see that 11111
jacerem (as the mss. give) was untenable on account of
the ambiguity produced by the two suhj. impl.

towards Bacchis has aroused his suspicions. 564 bisce

585-583 The dialogus between Syrus and Clitipho is
conducted in such expressions that Chremes believes that
syrus is merely upbraiding his son for his bed behaviour,
though at the same time the slave and Clitipho understand
each other periectly well. Only 1. 584 11 said asido in an
under tone. 567 deambulatum is quadrisyllabic both
