perverse to change the reading. The expression is aa

aa is, so far as the sense is concerned, equal to jor·
11111. 528 id is generally omitted in our editions
and is not given by the mss, but was ”rightly added by
Bentley on the authority of Priscian (p. 1143). It means
‘that point'. 529 Translate ‘why should 1 prelarto

The usual reading of this lineis atquc adeo 111 ipro tempore
1111111 ipsam chriam without Chremem. But Bentley y'ustly
observes that ipram alone would almost necessarily denote
Pamphilus who is the person spoken of in the last tvo
lines3 and he further points out that Donatus reads Chre·
arem in this line. He consequently omits obviam and sub·
stitutes Chremem. Ι think, however, thet my reading
(which 1 now find also in Klotz) is preferable to his-as
Donatus has obviam, and ipso before tempore probably
owes its origin to a gloss. Tho expression recurs v. 158.
