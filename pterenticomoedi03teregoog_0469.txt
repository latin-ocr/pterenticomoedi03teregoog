450 ADELPHOE.

Sannio's house to.Micio’s. It must be confessedthat this
is one of those places where the process of ‘contamination’
(as explained in our Introduction) can be detected hyan
attentive reader. 156 otiose seems rightly explained by
Guyet ‘otiose iam incedamus, σχολαίως, ἡσύχως, bellement‚
tout douoement’. if we do not put a comma after otiose, the
word will mean ‘fearlessly'‚ ‘secure’, as Donatus explains
it. 158 sc. tangam· 162 quod ‘as regards the proba·
bility that ’-163 1010010 said with an appropriate gesture,
as for the genitive comp. such phrases 00 flocci secere, nili
jacere, 110. 164 The antithesis oi verba and rea is like
Haut. 636. So the Greek λόγῳ and ἔργῳ. 165 1. The
mss. arrange the words as follows ius iurandum dubitirr, 10
esse irs—Dignum 1010110 lrcc;I have followed Fleok. in
adopting the transposition recommended by Richter.

167 ubi pree is like iprae Andr. 171: 01.Ε1111.499. Donatus
was doubtful whether to adopt this or another reading 0111
praestrenue. soris: see Introd. p. 19. Even Bentley allows ,
nihil to remam in 1110 text; but uili is given by Donatus
and was justly preferred by Guyet. 169 propter ‘near':

0001100 Parmeno hears geminabit, he repeats the blow. 1
have kept the text which is given in the mss. It is possible
to scan it by assuming a monosyllabic pronunciation of
01100οε0000 Fleckeisen, in order to avoid this, writes o 10-
dtgncm facinus: 0111 caves, geminabit. 175 relatis
monosyllabis: so again 177. regnumne: cf. Phorm. 405:
Plautus says dictator in asimilar passage Trin. 695.

176 matus: cf. Haut. 950. Pl. Capt. 997 ornatus 1001 ex

10 aon novi'nequc 0001000 adeo volo. 180 convitium is
the authenticated spelling, not convicium. erit melica ‘it
is advisable ’‚ the compar. is idiomatic in this phrase: see
Heindorf on Hor. Sat. 111, 45 nwlircs 000 tongere, clamo.
182 1111100011ογροφή ὕβρεως was the legal consequence
of the violation of 0 free-born Athenian. 185 actem ex-

10 an anapaest: see Introd. p. 15.11. 188 fateor stands
before pernicies communia in the mss: but an anapaest
being inadmissible in the caesura, Ihave followed the trans·
position recommended by Krauss. 189 100110 drops its
final a· 190 occepisti Bemb. according to Poliziano‘s
collation‚ coepisti the edd. 191 The common reading
is quaeres and then the whole line is given to Aeschinus;
but according to Krauss (111000111155811110 Bemb. has
1001100100, whence he elicited the true reading with a very
slight change. 192 According to Poliziano's 0011011011,
tibiis not in the Bemb. Ι have therefore bracketed it.
