01 dcepovcdcria: the first person is given by most 1111101
the 0111. 11111, and seems absolutely necessary as it is

scilicet with an infinitive, in accordanoe with the original
meaning 01 the word ‘you may be sure that he will give it
her’: see n. on v. 358 above. 858 According to my .
collation this line ie not in the Bemb. ms. nor is it abeo·
lutely necessary for the passage. Ihave thereiore bracketed
it without, however, absolutely denying its Terentina ori-

Menedemus is now thoroughly acquainted with the
whole trick practised on Chremes and is at last 111
a position to repay him with interest for the tutorial
superintendencc until now bestowed upon himself. So one

very errors we censured 'm them. 877 dicto is the
reading 01 the better class ο1 mss, e.g. the Bemb.,
while later mss. have 11111111 and this is an instance in
which the ‘harder’ reading deserves preference as it is at
the same time supported by ms. authority: see note on
v. 755. dicta is ‘epithets’. In v. 876 boc is rather ac·
