ratae minae, and from Lucilius Donatus quotes lectt omnes:

61 pridie the interrogative ‘and there what proiit would
it be ιο mel' 62 Both Plautus and Terence use the
phrases operam dore and dicare quite indiscriminately.

70 inpertiam ‘natural bent'. rea was, as ie its equivaleht
‘king’‚ used to denote any one and anything rich and
magnificent: as for the sense of the passage, it is impossi-
ble to explain it better than Donatus doce who observes
.⁴aoue rce': aad. very properly so, as Davus says ‘oh‚it I
were rich, how dillerent 1 should bel’ then Donatus adde
‘ostendit pauperum affectiones qui se solos uti divitiis
,scire aiunt, si eas habeant '·-an observation of great psy-
chological truthr 73 mihi marcenis ‘ I have had my
experiente ot it’: ol. Adi 895. 74 deo irato roeo will
become intelligible by comparing Andre 664. Donatus quotes
the corresponding phrase deo meo propitio from Naeviusr

76 Bentley changes the singular seas' into the plural
southa, on account ol v. 71: but this is overdoing logia
and the singular is readily understood by uneophisticated
readers. scopulos perdere a very emphatic expression:
‘my back got so well thrashed that it seemed to have lost
all leeling'3 cf. the analogous phrase comam perdidt Pa
Epid. 1 1, 84. 77 ocra qaae tor praeeram.

78 advorsum stimulam colom so. iactare, is the Latiis
translation ot the well-known Greek proverb πρὸς κέντρον
(01· κέντρα) horrisae (Aeeoh. Prom. viuct. 324. Agant. 1624.
,Pindus Pyth. 11 Hermonassa. 795⁸ Acta Apostr 9. 5)r
the variety calcitrare eontra stimulata is quoted from Arn-
mianus Marcellinus. 79 Itis characteristic oi slaveeto
use proverbe and idiomatis expressions such as we have had
to notice throughout the scene. Here again Donatus interme
us that acati ott soro was ‘vulgare proverbium'‚ which, he
says, was originally applied to merchants who adapted their
prices to the marhot as they chanced to lind it; we may say
‘you knew how to mehe the best ol the market’r 82 Per-
dite is explained ‘pro oalde’ by Charisius p. mamortha
authority of Arruntius Celeus oi whom he also quotes ano-
ther observation ‘antiqui enini dicebant ardere pro amare ⁹,
an observation which I at least cannot understand without
assuming that Arnmtius Celeus found in his copy oi
Terence ardere where we read nov amare: and it this
conclusion ie just, I do not see why we should not admit

ardere into the text For ardere oliqecem or aliquam see .
