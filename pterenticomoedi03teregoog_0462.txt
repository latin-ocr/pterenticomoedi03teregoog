ADELPHOD.

As Adclpbe is the reading of the Ambrosiam and Adel·
phoa of the Bembine ms, there can be little doubt that
Terence himself transcribed the Greek Ἀδελφοί by Adcl-
pboe, as I have observed in the jabrbdcber 1865 p. 289,
where Ι quote Osann on Cic. dere publ 11 33, 58 cosmoe:
κόσμοι. On the year in which this play was first exhibited,
see Introd. p. 4, and my observatione against Wilmanns
(de did. p. 47-51) relative to an exhibition made previous·
ly to the one attested hythe ‘didascalia’‚ in the jahrb. l. c.
What I have said there, holds good against Wilmanns as
well as against Ο. Dziatzko (rb. mea. xxr 79), not one oi
whose arguments Ι should say was overlooked by me,
though his article was written after mine. As to Donatus
who seys that Adelplwc Terenti was acted ‘secundo loco,
etiamtum rudi nomine pobiae’, I would especially draw
the attention of my readers to jahrb. l. c. p. 291, where Ι
think I give the most plausible solution of this diffieuty:
viz. that there was an alphabetical arrangement of the
Terentian plays which was followed by Donatus in several
instances.

Ι Egit L. Ambivios Turpio: there is in the mss. the
usual addition of L. Atilios Proca„ on which Ι comment in
several places. In the mss. of the Galliopian class we find
also Minucius Prothimaa instead of L. Ambtoisca Turpio,
very likely the actor mentioned by Donatus in his preface
to the Eunuchus. We know nothing further about him.

In the names of the coss. Ihave added Anicio in order
{ongbtain the regular and full form of a mention of this

For a ‘didascalia’ to the Adelphos found in the eod.
Ambrae. of Plautus (see Bitschl, Par. p. 251 ss. and praef.
Stichi p. v111) Ι must here ask the reader to consult my
introductory notice to the Stichus, which he will be able to
do, as soon as the fourth volume of an edition of Plautus
is out which Ι em at present preparing.
