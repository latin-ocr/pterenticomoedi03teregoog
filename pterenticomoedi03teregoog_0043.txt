22 INTRODUOTION.

Acron¹ and Euanthius3 we possess a commentary which ocn-
tains aconfused mass of notes, a grem part of which is cf
late origin, although the whole goes under the name of Do·
natue. Thenatas on the Hauton timoramencs are lost.
Another commentary by Eugraphius‚ which extends over all
the six comedies and was probably ccmpesed in the tenth

centmy, is of little use either for the criticism or the
explanation of Toronae.

In the middle ages Terence was much read as a standard
Latin author, and his comedies were even imitated (though

one can hardly say successfully) by the famous nun of Gan·
dornheim, Hrcsvitha

It may be easily conjectured that an author so widely

read as Terence was necessarily circulated in agreat num·
ber of copies, and there is indeed hardly any library in
Germany France or England without at least one ms. of
this poet. Yet there is only one ms. which should be con-
sidered a trustworthy guido for Terentian criticism: via.
the ancient ms. onae in the possession of the renowned
cardinal Pietro Bembo, now one cf the chief treasurss of
the Vatican Library, a ms. interesting elika for its anti·
quity (it belongs to the fifth century) and its beauty. Its
readings have been made known by Fuimus (Flor. 1565)
whose notes are also found in Bentley’s famous edition.
Two other msa, called Victorianus and Decartatas, belong
to the same family as the Bembiaas. This ancient and
venerable‘ me. is unfortunately mutilated at the commence-
ment; it begins with Andr. 786.

All other mss. represent the text as it was settled hya
late grammarian, Calliaptas. The oldest representatives of .

· this constitution of the text are three mss. of the ninth

century, the Ambrosianus Vaticanus and Basiliaaaae.
An edition cf Terence with a sufficient critical apparatus
is as yet a desideratum. Bentley was almost the first tc

· eammence a methodical criticism of the Terentian eome-

dies, but after all he was very arbitrary and frequently
ascribed far teo much weight to his late mss. in preference
te the Bembinus. It has, morecver, been justly observed

¹ 1 give this statement on the authority of Bernhardy, rom. litt.
p. 874: it appears, however, almost certain that Helenius Aaron
ffllilll‘essepffir part ol the second century. See Ο. Ribbeck.
