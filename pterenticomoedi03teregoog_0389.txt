poet and his intentione sofar as v. 34. The whole is
recited by the managei and not by a young actor, be·
cause Ambivius’ facundia (v. 13) was expected to produce
a favourable impression. (2) After this comes the reason,
which induced Ambivius to comply with the poet’s request,
viabis own wish to ask fora quiet and orderly behaviour
of the spectatore during the performanee: he thinks they
ought to do so out of regard ior himself and also for the
poet. This second part extends from v. 35 to the end.

After v.3 we are now, of course, obliged to assume a
gap of a few lines, e. g.

postquam quod instat maxume, perfecero:

etenim novisse dccet vos nomen scitulae,
hodie quam spectaturi convenistis hue.

We then have v. 4 and 5, and their sequel v. 10. nunc at
the commencement of v. 10 indicates nothing more than
regression to v. 2, as this particle often does. It will be
seen that, throughout this disquisition, we have never paid
the slightest attention to vv. 7-9: to say nothing of v. 6,
which has been justly rejected by Ihne in his ‘ Quaestiones
Terentianae', his view being accepted by Ritschl‚ Parerga 1
ael, andDziatzko p. 11. But even vv. 7-9 do not belong
to this prologue‚ as will be seen from the following argn-
ments: (l) ticcam esse ostendi. The Hautontimorumenos
was, it is true, nova· at the time oi its first exhibition‚ see
also v. 29. It was integra subala, i. e. not ‘contaminarent
for this is the true sense of integer, cf. Cic. Top. 18,
where we have an antithesis between integra and contami
natis, and integra latina ea integra praeca means ‘one
complete Latin play adopted from one complete Greek
play’: see also Dziatzko p. 8. But the word ostendaris
here without any sense at all, as nothing is demonstrated
in the preceding lines: Lessing's idea of supplying apud
aediles having been justly rejected by Daiatzko p. 8, note 1.
(a) When a play has not yet been exhibited as was then
the case with the Hauton timorumenos, how can the auili-
enee be supposed to know who were the authors of the
Greek and Latin plays? It may be ansvered that hadewig
in his essay ‘iiber den kanon des Volc. Sed! p. 14 was by
this very passage led to the conclusion that Menander‘s plays
were quite familiar to most Romans in the time of Terence,
and that his plays were much read even in their original lan-
guage. But surely this is giving the Romans of that time
more credit than they deservo: forthere can be little doubt
that but very few Romans oi that period understood Greek,
except of course the well-known patrous of Terence, least of
all those Romans who composed the noisy and unmannerly

audieuce in the theatre. (Imay now add. how many persons
among an English audience know anything of the real au·
thore ofthe French plays which they make acquaintance with
