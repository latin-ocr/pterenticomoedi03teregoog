in several passages of the ancient poets3 but the line hers
generally quoted byrris νοσοῦντα ῥᾷστα ads τις νουθετεῖ, is
not by Menander, but Muretus. 310 bic ‘mysehi
comp. buis lwmtas' Haut. 356. Bentley considers bic ss
adv. = boc loco ‘in my place': itis quite indifferent to
the sense which explanation we prefer. cpe aye ut lubet
‘well‚ well, justas you plesse! Byrria confesses tharsis
no gainsaying general maxims. 313 With prodat dies
comp. 329 dies profer. Donatus quotes from Lucilius ca
porro prodendo dies sit· 314 fiet aliquid ‘something
will tum up.' 315 at depende upon something like
impetrabis or impetrare poteris. 317 abire ia aulem
rem ἐς κόρακας ἰέναι, Avery similar passage is quoted
from Pl. Epid. 1 1, 72 obi io emtam rem mammosa c me
cum istae condicione. suspitio seems the genuine spelling
of the noun, srssplcio of the werb; they differ alsoin
quantity. The long i in the noun is due either to eon·
traction from serapionis, or to the loss of a c, as the origirm
form might have been suspectio. scelus=sceleste‚ fre·
quently thus used in the comio poets. 320 Bentley
was the first to draw attention to the reading givenby
Eugraphius which we too have adopted in our text. The
reading aeque arietet copiam of the mss. is against the
matre, for to assume a hiatus citeraeque and a lengthen-
ing of the penult in ocelli by ‘ictus’ (as an imprudent
editor does) is the utmost of perversity. And though it
is true that no other passage occurs where od stands after
copto, Eugraphius' reading seems sufficiently supported by
the reading od auxiliandum which is given by three late
mss. Itis not, however, impossible that Terence wrote some·
thing like aeque mi copia assiliat, but in the absence of
any further proois aconjecture of this kind cannot be
received with confidence. 327 principio μάλισταμέν.
potest ‘is possible:' thus we frequently find potest as
impera. in the cemic poeta, especially in tho phrase quantam
potest ‘as soon as possible! Sc even Cicero Tusa. 1
11, 23, si posset. 328 baec as fem. plur. is of frequent
occurrence in archaie languaga and is also found in Cicero.
Of. 438. 329 oscelam one werd, like ettam and qas-
as'om: see 171. 330 oe utiquam is shownby themetreto
be the genuine form in Terence, as the first syllable mua
be short here. ef. Hec. 125. Haut. 357. 331 sorta
tare ‘to expect) With gratioe adponere compare Horaee’s

well-known quem sors dierum caraque dubit, lucro Adpone.
332 apiscor is frequently found in archaie and post-
classic language instead of the oompound adipiscor: see
noteon Haut. 693. 334 The asyndeton is regularis
imperatiwes both in Greek and Latin. Thus Aristophanes
τόλμησον ἴθι χώρησον, ἄγαμαι καρδίας hohern. 463. Pl.
Bacch. 693, compara lubricosa fraqe qoadtubet conglutino.
