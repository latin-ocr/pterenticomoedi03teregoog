11 this 10 the case now-adays when civilization is more genc-
ral than in the time of Terence, what would it be then t) But
these doubts and difficulties would disappear in case we read
the lines in question under the following conditione: (l) it
shall be previously said, that the play is 0000, whence it
might follow that the case would have been doubtful with-
out an explanation of this kind 3 (1)οο are prepared to
understand the familiarity of the spectatore with the names
of both the Greek and Latin author, 11 indeed the play was
previously known to them. These conditione are found
to exist in the Hecyra. After the first unsuccessful exhi·
bition of the play, Terence put it asido for a long time,

until at last he ventured to produce it again, after hav· ·

ing re-written it, as it seems. 11 10 in this way he ob·

'No one would, of course, credit the poet's words unless
further explanatione were added, and indeed the poet is
going to inform ue at greater length of the circumstances:
but then eomes the gap pointed out bthne (see note on
Hec. prol.) At the conclusion of the demonstration that
the play was indeed noco, we ought to place the three lines
which 0 curicus fate has carried 011 to the prologus of the
Hauton timorumenos, whence Dziatzho was the first to
remove them 10 their original place.

Throughout this play we are deprived of the valuable
assistance afforded us in the other plays by Donatus’ com-
mentary.

by Westerhovius ‘sensus videturesse, Terentium in hae
fabula duos fecisse filios familias amatores, duas amicas,
duos servos, duos etiam senes, quum 11000 omnia simplicia
eareat ia Meae-ridvo’. If thisbe a satisfactory explanation
(and it seems indeed to be the only one of which the words
00 they stand are capable), we should have to assume
that the play was ‘contaminatcd': which would be against
Terence’s own assertion v. 4. Bentley reads simplex quoe...
duplici, where the sense is quite satisfactory, but the laws of
