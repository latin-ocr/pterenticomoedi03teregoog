Introd. p. 14; in order to avoid thie quantity, the editors
read si cetera ita eant 111 vis.- but I sec uo reason to deviato

so fer as I know against the msa: later on (654) he has
reddar with the mss. Instead of 11, the mes. have eae.

98. 862. Phorm. 140. 1631. Laches either does not under-
stand the irony in Pamphilus' words, or else will not ses it.
