to the house 01 Nausistrata. The genitive 01101 vercor occurs
repeatedly in older writers, 1. g. guae 1100 vereatur viri 111011.
· 99. and cuiue veretur Pac. 183. 972 0000 may here be
taken either 01 apyrrhich with a ahortened pronunciation 01
the dativa] ending, 01 which there are many other instances
in the comio poets3 or else we may assume a monosyllabio
pronunciation=uuo (01. 1100001101 contracted to uuatiua), but
this ie 01101 all much lese probable than our first supposition
which agrees better with the general law explained in the
Introd. p. 14. 974 tuceuaom dabo: 01. Andr. 681.

terror ‘into a desert', 00111 ΡΙ. llud. 227, where we havetha
very sama expression. 981 The words buc, 11 quid lubet
are pronounoed in a very loud voice, as Phormio now wants
10 bring Nausistrata 0111011111 house. He is making 101
the house, where the two 10001 010 10 find their tus awarded

(100101 spirited acting in order 10 become intelligible.
When Chremes calla upon Demipho 10 help him against
Phormio, Demipho comes and at all events lays hold ot,
perhaps aven strikes Phormio who then calls out ‘there’s
one action 1010110011 against -you'‚ upon which Chremes

989 The mss. read exclude, with tha exception 01 the
Bemb. ms. which'reads exculpe. The reading exclude is,
however, 0110 supported hy Priscian who quotes the line 11

Terence is also supported by a passage in Pl. Pseud. 510

where the mss. again give eucludito mi bercle oculum, but
Riteohl amends calidito, in imitation 01 which emendation
Fleckeisen here, too, writes calide, and him I have 101-

The following scene is, 101 genuina humour, one 01 the best
