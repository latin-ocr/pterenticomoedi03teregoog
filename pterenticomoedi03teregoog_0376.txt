here, atate 0011111111 ‘a worthless bargain’, occurs also Pl.
Pseud 133. Similarly Cicero says 11010 emptus ad Att. ni
6¹71 tac is put aiter reditio, aethe verbal noun in
archaia langnage frequently has the same construction as
the verb iteeli: coni. Pl. Rnd 0021, quid miti 00010110 tibi

adds that colore mustelino would hardly have any distinct
