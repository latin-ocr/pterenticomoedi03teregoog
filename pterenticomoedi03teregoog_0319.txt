§269, τὸδὲ καὶτοῖς treas εὐεργεσίας ὑπομιμνήσκειν καὶ λέγειν
μικροῦ δεῖν ὅμοιόν ε’στι τῷ ὀνειδίζειν. ‚ 45 quiri dic ‘why

don‘t you rather say at oncet’ quidest, not qaid sit: the .
direct form of the question being retained. This vill bs

frequently met with in the comio poete. Of. e. g. Haut

310. 349. 46 praediea ‘before entering into further

details, I tell you at once'. 47 qaas is here = quater.

51 excessit ea ephebis ἐξῆλθεν ἐξ ἐφήβων (lien. Oyr. rt.

Mero. 61 has the same expression; Cic says abi μνίπιιιιο ea
pueris excessit, pro Arch. 3, 4. The termination ot the ὲφηβίι
was most probably at the age of 20: so Teles ap. Stob. flor.
96, 72 ἐξ ἐφήβων ἐστί καί ἤδη εἴκοσιν ἑτῶν. 52 litam
or rather iibria' is here the pronunciation required by the
metra, though not accepted hy Bentley and other editors
Similarly we find libreis and leibravit instead of tiberis and
liberarit in an Inscription in Th. Mommsen’s Inscr. Regni
Neap. no. 299. Cf. also dextra for dexterarum and infra
for supera and infera, and other instances ot the same kind
The comparative should be explained ‘a little more freely:
viz. than before. Of. Nep.' Them. 1, 2 qai qaam minas esset
waterus pareatibus, qaod et liberius vivebat et remsamiti-
arem neglegebat eqs. antea occurs only here in Terence,
and is never found in Plautus. The punctuation of our

. text ie in itself sufficient 1ο show the irregularity of the

construction of the whole sentence. Simo resumes 0110111

the comio poete, but not exactly classic: ao Haut. 830.
Phorm. 172. adolescentuli (the a ie in this word preferable
to the ο) ‘very young men’‚ the diminutive expresses their
want oi experience. 56 i αἰτοῦσιν οί χρηστοί [νεανίαι]

mere argentariam instead oi adimendi. 57 ad pleitr-
soplos is very characteristic of Athens, but does not apply
to Rome as it was at the time of Terence. Plautus would
surely have omitted an allusion so thoroughly Greek aa

Truc, 11. 3, 16. egregie and praeter cetera are almost sy·
