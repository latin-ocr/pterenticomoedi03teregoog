to his slaves and household, is tha 10001 which will take place
on his funeral. 588 For Aeschinus 000 Introd. p. 14.
591 sorbillare 10 the reading 01 all mss. with the exception
01 the cod. Meadianus which has corbilaua; this latter spell-
ing is justly preferred by Guyet and Bentley: cf. ventilare
and the decisivo line in Pl. Poen. 12, 182 (=390 Geppert)
0011 milii iam uideo propter te victitandum 0001110. The
word sorbilare occure again in Appuleius.

505 f. ultro in both passages means ‘moreovcr't it is
easy to 000 how it pasees into this sense from ite origi-
nal meaning ‘fcrward voluntarily'. 697 It seems
improbable that 10 acimum iuducere aliquem should be a
Latin construction: at least tha passage commonly quoted
by the commentatore, Haut. 1028, proves nothing at all.
Ihave‚ therefore, added 0000 with Guyet and omitted in
which the mss. read before culmum. 508 virginis ie

1867 p. 208. 600 Ηο10 we expect 10 hear the pre-
cise truth concamiug the psaltria: 101 11 would be absurd
to tell Sostrata that the suspicions against Aeschinus arose

. on account 01 the psaltria, a circumstance 01 which she

was well aware. Bentley writes propter fratrem case.- eius
0000 1110111001 but 1 think Fleck. 10 right in assuming a gap,
which may be filled up with euch a line as the following
01 Aeschino raptum 1000 fratrem 000 cidiuvoret clanculum.

601 This passage was corrupt 00 101 back as the time 01
Donatus who observes ‘sane hi versue desunt quoe multa
exemplaria non habent'. 602 Fleck. writes relevaris
(Bentl. rellevaria) on account 01 fucris functus in the next
line, but 1 do not see why the poet should not be allowed 10
varyinthetense: 01.Ηο0.599. 603 traomofficiurais
Fleckeisen’s correction: the comio poete always connect
,fungi with an accusative. 604 The hiatus after dixti is
legitimate on account 01 the change 01 speakers. 605
