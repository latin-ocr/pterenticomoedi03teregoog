‘pai-ry 1 blow’; hence it also means ‘frustrate' and ‘ds-
oeive'. Here we may perhaps translate it in its very first
oense, ‘make sport of’. 56 proin monosyllabic. 59
On plurale 01 the same kind 11 iniuriae eucpitioaee 101011·
citiae indutiae which denote repetitions of the same act,
see note on Andr. 552. 60 indutiae not induciae ie the
genuine spallinges shown by the best mss. 01 Plautus,
Terence, Caesar, Cicero, Sallust, Livy, and Tacitus. Gel-
lius 125, 17 gives it as the opinion of Aurelius Opilius
that the word is ‘quusi iaduitiae'; an etymology which,
whether wrong or right, at all events speaks in favour 01
ἕὸξύμωρον 111, sed convenit comico: nam nemo sanus insa-
nit’ Schol. Bemb. 64 qreod ‘as regards your' etc.
’ The expression aecum copitare recurs Eun. 636 and Ad. 808.
65 Priscian supplies the ellipticalexpressions 01 thie line
in the following manner, epoae ittam dipaer adveatu uteo!
quae illum praeposuit 1111111 quae me sprevit, quae 00111111-
cepa 11111 The words siae 01010 generally convey 1 threat
(like the German tuae put seia): Phorm. 420. 67 me
111011 is never trisyllabic in Terence 01 other comio poete :
nnn could easily escape the eye 011 scribe before uns.
lacrimula ‘a wretched little tear'. 68 misere is cx-
plained=male by Charisius 6184: but it belongs to tercado,
‘rubbing hereyes in a wretched manner’. In via vt note
the 1111101111011 and paronomasia. 69 eaba reatiupuere
is said like ardorem or flammam restiapuere: 01. aliquem
reattupuere Phorm. 975. ultro accusabit: she will come and
heep reproaches 011 you without waiting 101 you to upbreid
her. 72 ptudemactene without et in conformity with
the usage of ancient Latin: Cicero interposes et ad fam. vr
6, 6, and pro Marc. 5, where he uses the same expression.
73 vivae eidemque, ζιδν eol βλέπωνε observa again the allite-
ration. From Cicero pro 811127 we learn that the cx-
pression was proverbial: uictu, ut uiuat, eet eidemque,
cf. also 0100 atquc uidenti Lucr. 111 1046. 74 ¹captum
‘taken in war’: ses the similar passage, Andr. 82. Ηο 11
10 ransom himself at the lowest price. 75 In the
same way aswe have here first the abl. minuma and pctu-
tulo‚ and afterwards the genitive pucati (11 thie indeed be
a genitive), we have both joined in Pl. Epid11a110,
pucati minuata pateat eati. 79 calamitas in rustic lan·
gange denotes a blast or blight which falls on the fruits: 10
Cicero, Verr. 113, 98, 0000110 pretium uici ia calamitate

snectutem 0011110111. The metaphorical use of the word in
this passage is easily understood.

80 intercipit ‘quasi totum capit' as Donatus explains:
but iuter means here ‘between the starting-point and the
gaal, .’ 81 In miseram rae observa the enclitic posi·
