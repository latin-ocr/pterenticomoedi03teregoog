consonant is dropt. These two cases will be found analo-
gous to the instances collected in 5 11.

IV. The tendency of ehortening long syllables when
unaccented was also assisted by the grase indifferenee of the

language of that period in regard to double and simple
consonante. In fact, double consonante were entirely un-
known in Latin before Enniue(1ntrod. to the Aul. p. xli).
Thue ll does not atfeot the quantity of the preceding vowel
in supellectile Phorm. 666; and the pronoun ille with its
derivativas is used as a pyrrhich in numerous instanees,

. Terence himself probably writing ite. In the same way mm

does not lengthen the first syllable in the word emtam· aa

fallaci course, under the same head and mo likewiee, ae
there is little doubt that thie combination of consonante
was sounded by the Roman like aa (Schuchardt 1, 146 f.);
thie explains the short quantity of the first syllable in omnes
in various passages (e. g. Andr. 694). pp has only the effect
of a single p Ad. 238 and sl:

per oppressionem ut hene mi eripere pestulat
gaudemus. Dr. ehem opportune: te ipsum quaerito.

As thie law holds good of all double consonante, we
daem it‘ unneceseary to dwell upon thie point at greater
l .
θῃῗξοοὴοτ feature characteristic of the Latin language
during this periodis the attenuation and in many caece en-
tire disappearance of the letter a before a and in general

ο before dentale and gutturals: see Schuchardt, 1, 104 ff.

Thus we find in Terence ’

qued intellexi Eun. 737.

sed interim Haut. 882.
neque Intelleges Phorm. 806.
ego interea Hac. 42.

quid interest Eun. 233.

sine Invidia Andr. 66.
bonum ingenium Andr. 466.

In tha earne way tede and aede occur with the first syllable
{1³23ss various passages, but only in case a short eyllable

2-2.
