Dziatzko avails himself of 0 suggestion 01 Ritsohl, who
assumes a gap after 1. 2. By repeating here his own at-
tempt 01 restoring the lost connexion of the passage, it will
be easy fo give the reader an idea of Dziatzko’s conception
of the whole. He is of opinion that Terence wrote some-
thing like the following:

1100υοί 011 vostrum mirum, quor partis seni

pocta dederit, quae sunt adulescentium,

nuno duam obrem 1100 partis didicerim, paucis dabo.

As for 11110, I would observo that Terence himself
never mentions his own name in any of his prologues,
and that it seems therefore unadvisable to introduce nostis
Afer Publius in the gap. Again, Daiatzko himself shows in
his dissertation thatthe tituli pronuntiatio generally took
place prior 10 the recital of the prologus, yet assumes 01
the same 111110 that this habit was not observed in the
present instance. Ritschl assumes 0100 agap 01101 1. 5:
the first part of 1110 prologus consiste in the mere an-
nouncement of the title, and 01 the Greek and Latin authors
of the play, 0110001 according 10 Dziatzko's restoration
which, he says, coincides with Ritschl's 1101101 the matter.
Without assuming a gap, this first part would consist oi
only two lines, and after 111000, 1111011110 says p. 11, the
poet could not continue ‘tam verboso transitu’ 0000 qaam
obrem and so on. This sounds quite plausible, but is the
0000 much improved by having four lines instead 01 two?
As it is, lennes would still belong to the second part, con-
taining the author's petition ior indulgence; and the pro·
portion 4 ι 42 10 01111 so unaqual, that this argument for
assuming 0 gap-and it is the only one we are favoured
with-appears somewhat weak. And this is, no doubt,
Dziatzko’s own impression, when he concludes p. 17 by say-
ing ‘sedasse ante 1. 10 alia quoque interciderunt; sed
certa (f) ratiocinatione nihil praeterea statuere possumns‘.

, Iconfess I cau see no reason why we shouldhere assume
a deviation from the customary mention 01 the title and the
author of the play previous to its performance. Only in so
doing we should not assume a gap before v. 3, but directly
after it. As to myself‚ I take 0 different view of the logical '
disposition of the prologus: (1) we are informed why the
poet sends Ambivius, and this part commences 1. 11 01010-
rem esee voluit 010, ewa prologum, and 11011001 0111101 the
