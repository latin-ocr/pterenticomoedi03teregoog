404 PHORMIO.

ludum (so. fidicinam Pl. Rud. 43) duem et redducere sre
merely the c'ontrivances he had to resort 10 in order to
accomplish hisaim: oeulos poscere. 87 otient‘having
nothing else to do': Donatus quotes the corresponding words
of Apollodorus, but as usual, the Greek is almost hope·
lessly corrupt: ΝΑλΚΕΙΣ δεσυνεμαλι μΕΟΛ, where the
last two words may have been δὲ stromateas» or -otrtra
operam darc is explained by redere v. 91. 88 eaudcorsrrc
occurs again v. 97, but with a different aceent. An observa-
tion related by Gellius vrr 7, 4 shows what inaccurate phi·
lologers the anoients were. 89 toetrc'rea is an excellent
form instead of tonstrina, owing 10 the soft pronunciation
of re before s: cf. the Plautian forms mestrem waecwetro
proecwstrore (11010111 on the name Mostellaria in his edi·
tion 01 the play p. 1). 90 darc inde e'ret 1101111111 in
order 10 redducere. 95 For 1001001100 see note on
Andr. 70. 97 1001001011 ‘patron' as a subet: cf. Pl.
Persa 650. Trin. 46. 1148.Ρο01111. 699. Μο01. 195.

99 adiutare stands here just like adiuvare, and in general
frequentatives are often used in the language of the comio
poets in pretty nearly the same sensa 00 the original verbs:
01. 0100 Hec. 369. 105 With this and the following
lines compare the passage iu the Hauton timorumenos 286
-291, · 110 scita is explained by Festus p. 330‘bona
facie’, and Donatus justly compares Andr. 486 scitus

puer. d 113 111 scot etue the first syllable of 010010

0110110110 : see Introd. p. 20. vi. ereim=enimvero

123 confideres in a bad sense ‘pro improbo audaci 00101110-
rario’ (Doulz cf. Lucilius’ line improtu’ confideres maleta et
cuquam 1111100101. qui in execratione has the same power
as uticam: cf. Pl. Trin. 923. 997. Μο11. 308. ’197 dicam
eerflrere γράφεσθαι δίκην occurs 111 two other passages of
the Phormio: v. 329 and 668. Terence took the expres·
sion from Plautus: see my 11010 011 Aul. 753.

130 qutadv. ‘in what manner’. 131 The words
quod erit mitt 10111111 atque comrnodcm are generally con·
nected with the preceding sentence and 0001109001.- but
they are more easily understood if we join them with the
following sentence ‘and if you donet 1011110 my charge,
which circumstance will be to my advantage, I shall of
course gain my suit'. 138 011 this common-place
Donatus observes with much justice ‘hae graves sententiae
ex persona servorum cum dicuntur, ridiculas suntet eo
consilio interponuntur’. cr. Ennius' line which 111 the
Annales was put into 1110 11111111 01 Pyrrhus quidve serat
Fore Virtute experiamur (204 Vahlen). The eontrast be·
tween a Geta and a Pyrrhus needs no illustration. 140
eredo is ironioal: for the precator see Haut. 976.
