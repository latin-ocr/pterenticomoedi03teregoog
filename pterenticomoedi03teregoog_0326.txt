'Norae 307
rae laet syllable ol temeret retains its original long

quantity. 214 The text is intelliglble as it stands,
but there seems to be little doubt that Guyet is right in
emending qua iare queque iniuria καὶ δικαίως κάδίκως as
Arist. Plut. 233 says. Donatus says ‘proverbiale hoc est',
which can well apply to Guyet's reading, but not to that ci
the mss. and editions—at least I cannot see how it applies
to the latter. 216 aiace is the regular construction in
the language oi the comio poete, never aive-aive. 218
rhe similar scund ol enuntiem and amantium was no doubt
easily perceived and admitted by Roman ears in spite ol the
difference ol quantity. cf. a similar pun in Livy 11147,
tunm vie oetentiae aeriae qoem ameria meatem turbaverat.
219 Ol. Pl. Amph. 501, quod erit aetam tollito: the neuter
on account oi the uncertainty ol the aex oi the expected
child tollo is the regular word ol recognizing a child aa
one's own. Ol. 464. 220 ieter se: as the pronoun
actually becomes one word with the preceding preposition‚
it has the power oi drawing the accent on the second sylla·
hle. 221 Davus imitatas the way in which the matter
is put by the lovers themselves (α διηγηματικῷ ad μιμητικὸν
tramit' Donatus). seit olim is a usual beginning ol fables
and nursery tales, cf. Pl. Stich. 539 and Hor. Sat. 11 6, 791.
biae is quite indispensable ior the sense of the passage and
hae, therefore, justly been added by Bentley: as to gram·
mar, ol. 833. 892. 224 orbum parvum without the
copula, cl. 248. 225 As a line ol this length would
be quite out oi place here, and more especially as other
instanaes oi a tetram. troch. hypercat. do not occur, Bent-
ley must be right in rejecting this line as a superfluous
gloas ol the word fabulae. 226 ab eo, ie. ont of her
hcuse; similar phrases are ol irequent occurrence in the
comio poeta, cl. eg. Eun. 545. Phorm. 732. Haut. 510.
ere ad sorum sc. conferam, cl. 361. Young men without
any particular occupatiori used to stroll about the forem
where they were most likely to hear the news of the day. cf.
especially accessi ad adulescentie ia soro, Pl. Capt. 475.

Sa. 2. Mysis is at first speaking to Archilis who ie
lucide the house, and then sets off on her errand when
she is stopped by the arrival of Pamphilus.

228 iamdudum: Arehilis had repeated her order se·
veral times belore Mysis paid any attention to it. Cf. PL
Mero. 953, iamdudum audivi. ⁴ ,229 temulenta: hence
perhaps her name Lesbia, the island oi Lesbos being noted
lor ite good wine. 231 Alter having spoken the first
three linea, Mysis pauses fora moment to get an answer
from insidet next she proncunces tamen eam adducam and
turns then to the spectatore. aniculae: the diminutive ex·
pressescontempt. 234 cruciaretur ‘out oi breath’.
