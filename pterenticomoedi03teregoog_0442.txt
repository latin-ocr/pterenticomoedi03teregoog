NOTES. ’ ira

nonnoed like 1111111 cet. 853 It is true, the Bemb. has
1101110 heminam, but Bentley justifies 1111 order we give in
our text (and which is also found in all other mss. but the
Bemb.) by referring to Ad. 218 bominum 1101110 stultissumc.
854 camorata. 856 delibatae gaudio orig. ‘be-
smeared with joy', as if joy were an ointment; Appuleius
has the analogous phrase delibutus laetitia. 857 auser:

see 011 v. 223. 859 dpud for-r the preposition drops
111 final d· 8001111111110110111111111011. 865
Sophrona, is in perfect accordance with the habit of even
Augustan prosody‚ in which the nom. -o repeatedly ap-
pears long in proper names of Greek origin: 01. Nausic·
110101. 1037. 887 suspenso gradu ‘on tiptoe’, what
Phaedrus 114, 18 calls suspenso pede. Ovid, Fast. 1426,
has the same expression as Terence. 860 captore
‘try to catch' : the phrase aerumnam captare occurs also in
Pl. Cas. 118, 8. In saying 1101 ruodo, Geta imitates the
position in which he stood near the door. 877 dabo
almost equal in meaning to dicam: 01.Η1111.,10. 800
My tert gives 1111 reading of the Bemb. ms.; others read
01111 habendae ee dare. · 881 It is due toanoversight of
mine that the text gives Fleckeisen's (1.1. Bentley’s) reading
of this passage. The Bemb. ms. sanctione only 11111111 uim,
which is quite in harmony with the laws of comio versi·
fication, 11 cum is an enclitic and naturally draws the
acoent on 10 the last syllable of the preceding word The
same ms. seems to omit em 11 the end of thelina, though
this isfound in 111 the mss. used by Bentley. 888
The construction of the preceding line would necessitate
adimendi here, but negligences like this 111 excusable in
the language of every-day life of which comedy is only a
faithful representative. Instanoes of infinitives after occa-
110 occur also in Plautus: see Brix on Gapt. 421. 889
11ἕοζὲεέίὲ ‘ in spite of all opposition’. ei in the next line is
⁶ 1 ’11’.

896 Ihave followed Fleckeisen in putting this linc
here, as·it is no doubt 1111111110 relate to Antiphila,
whereas if read after 906 (where the mss. place it), it is
quite out of place. 1111110111 ‘a thorough lady’. uti diat,
in a conversation which is left 10 the imagination of the
reader to supply. 897 pacatum potest ‘as quiok 11
possible’. 888 dilapidat is the reading of the Bemb.‚
while other mss. have the subjunctive dilapidet. Either
is possible, but we are bound 1ο submit to the authority of
the best ms. 901 ibamus ‘we were just going'.

991 eadem is disyllabic. 802 In verebamini we
have 1 very strong instance of the extension of the metrical
law explained in the Introd. p. 15 sub 11. 903 recepia-
11111 ‘had promised’: see (110. ad fam. xm 3. 804
