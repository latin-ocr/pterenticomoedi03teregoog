puae ‘she who'. I note this because even Donatus takes
puae for 1 neuter plur. 300 aut is tho reading ot one
ol Faernus* 11111, and the only one that gives a satisfactory
sense: 1111 other mss. have haud (or taut), and Donatus, ee
usual, sides with them. It seems that the mss. add quidem
between aut and berula and this may be defended by-
assuming 1 shortening ot the first syllable in treacle, tor
which see my Introd. to the Aulul. p. xnvr. Parmeno
seys ‘or indeed 1 slight thing may have caused this
onmity’. 307 1111111111 and iniuriae aro due to Bentl.;
the mss. giving maxumus end iniuriae. Donatus gives the
sense required by logio ‘iniuriae faciunt irae', but tries to
explain tho eoeusatives by assuming ‘hypallage’. Suoh
an ‘hypallage’ would however be monstrous tor aaa 111111·

In our reading we have the seme figure, buteo expressed

pre-cisely the same matters, where another would not even
get angry, one who has onoe got angry turns into 1111 bitter-
est enemy’. Donatus notioes the slight irregularity in the
expression de eadem oaaaa instead oi de eisdem rebla.
