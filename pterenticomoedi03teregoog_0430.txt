ingly good-natured admonition respice aetutem taam is the
hardest eut 91 all, end Demipho is quite unable to restrain
his passion any longer. 439 On tibi inpingere see
lntrod p'. 19. The phrase dicam inpingere is highly ex·
pressive, as it reminds the heerer at once 91 the original
phrase 91 pugnos inpingere. 440 Phormio‘s last
