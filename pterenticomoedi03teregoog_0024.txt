see, the poor poet required powertul patronage to support
him-yet hia words (and why ahonld we not believe hirnt)
suffice to show that his work was bia own, although we may
believe that he received occasional hints from his friends
who ware, as we said batere, highly interested in the
success ol hie comediea. For there ia a vast ffinsmnce
between Terence and his predecessore. They had been
content to please their audianoe and hed. consequantly‚
conformed to the taste ot their time, but Terence pursued
a direction diametrically opposite, inaamuch aa he under-
took to teach his audienco and to correct their teste, in
not giving them such playa as they could admira but
euch as they ought το admire, should their teste prove
to be correct. We huow vary little ol Statius’ way ol
translating Greek plays into Latin, but as regards Plautus,
it is certain that he was by no means particular as το
preserving the Greek character ol the playa he translated,
intermixing‚ as he does, numerous allusione end jokes
based upon institutione or eustoms purely Roman. This
might be pleaaing το the coarse taste of what we now ’;
would call the ‘gallsryss but necessarily offended the re·
fined taeta of men ol higher culture. These were ol course
few in number when compared with the mob that filled
the theatres and generally deeided the success ol a new
play: and now Terence boldly comes forward and gives his
audianos to understand that what has been approved ol
by the beat ln the land, ought likewise το plesse them
(hd prol. 1⁵ a). Like all reformare, he iared ill in his
own bietine, but was rewarded by posterity. His first
play, tha Andriam had been favourably received and recom-
mended by such an authority as bacchius Statius, the poet
cl the day; it was subsequently brought out, but without
the conventional prologue in which it was the cuntem
to acquaint an unattentive audience with the plot of the
play, and at once virulent calumnias became lond ou
the part ol Terence’s opponente, among whom a certain
poet ol the old school, Luscius Lavinius, seems to have
been the voret clamoursr. Terence himself diadains men·
